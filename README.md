# lpo-calculator
A rudimentary calculator for lease purchase program drivers at a previous organization - making calculation for revenue per mile easier
for operations staff that frequently dealt with the isssue. The question that was asked was "What am I making per mile?" This program helped address that quickly and easily.  

Formula is currently based on "assumed" on time pick up and delivery, which is 70% of the gross value. Failure to make the pick up or delivery windows incurred a 10% penalty in the gross revenue (60%) 

Future iterations will include a "failure" option to outline and highlight gravity of on time p/u and delivery.
